## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#24305E) to evoke trust and promote focus.
- Background color: Off-white (#F4F4F7) for comfortable readability and to provide contrast.
- Accent color: Teal (#45B69C) for interactive elements, highlighting a sense of well-being.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif with a slightly warm and modern feel, is recommended for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist, clear icons that are easily recognizable, aiding intuitive navigation. Outline style icons are preferred.
- A clean, modern layout that's easy to navigate. Ensure content is well-spaced and uncluttered.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth, engaging experience. Avoid excessive or distracting animations.
- Based on the reference image, the layout will feature a user profile section at the top, followed by key information cards such as 'Today's Focus' and 'Vision Score'.  Below these cards, 'Upcoming Reminders' and 'Recent Activity' will be displayed. At the very bottom of the screen, a navigation bar with icons for 'Home', 'Tests', 'Gym', 'Reminders', and 'Profile' will be implemented for easy access to different sections of the app.
- Adhere to a dark theme for the background, using a dark gray or black to reduce eye strain, complemented by light text (white or light gray) for readability.  The primary action buttons should utilize a vibrant teal to draw attention and guide the user.
- Use a clear, modern font such as 'Roboto' or 'Open Sans' for all text elements.  Ensure that the text is large enough and has sufficient contrast against the background to maintain excellent readability. Vary font weights and sizes to create a clear visual hierarchy.
- Consistent with the reference image, the iconography should be simple and outline-based.  Use icons to represent different sections of the app in the bottom navigation bar. Also, use icons to represent different eye exercises to improve comprehension.
